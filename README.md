This repository contains the configuration files for the Smoldyn models created for the mini project 'Multiscale spatial models of Salmonella enterica within-host infection dynamics' as part of the Part III Systems Biology course at the University of Cambridge.

Running simulations requires Smoldyn (which free to download here: https://www.smoldyn.org/) and the analysis pipeline is written in R (https://www.r-project.org/) using the libraries listed at the beginning of the script.
